    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Air Fryer Chicken Wings are the best and crispiest wings ever! Done in less than 20 minutes, you'll never make wings another way again!</p>
    <p>The air fryer is an appliance that basically takes cooking to another level...an easier and faster method for everything. These Air Fryer Chicken Wings not only take a fraction of the time of baking, but get so crispy you'll think they are fried.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken wings (drums and flats) (defrosted if frozen)</li>
        <li>1 TBS olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the chicken wings. If full wings, separate them into drums and flats. Make sure they are defrosted. Pat them dry completely dry (this will help them get crispy).</li>
        <li>Place the wings into a bowl and drizzle olive oil oven them. Toss to coat. Add garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss to completely coat the wings.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Air Fryer at 400 F degrees for 2 minutes. Add wings in a single layer to the air fryer (they should NOT be touching), and cook for 10 minutes at 400 F degrees.</li>
